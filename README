Network Inference Toolkit

A bunch of scripts written to infer correlation/partial correlation networks from data. Some of these may not be entirely correct!

Implemented:
SPACE - Partial Correlation Estimation by Joint Sparse Regression Models  by Peng, Wang and Zhu - https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2009.0126
SCIO - Fast and adaptive sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions - Liu and Luo - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2014.11.005
