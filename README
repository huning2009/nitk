Network Inference Toolkit

A bunch of scripts written to infer correlation/partial correlation networks from data. The goal is to have them like sklearn models. Currently very much
a work in progress

SPACE - Partial Correlation Estimation by Joint Sparse Regression Models  by Peng, Wang and Zhu - https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2009.0126
SCIO - Fast and adaptive sparse precision matrix estimation in high dimensions - Liu and Luo - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2014.11.005
CLIME - A Constrained L1 Minimization Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation - Cai, Liu and Luo - https://doi.org/10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10155
DTrace - Sparse precision matrix estimation via lasso penalized D-trace loss - Zou and Zhang - https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/ast059
Correlation Permutation - Estimates a sparse correlation matrix by permuting the dataset repeatedly to get a p-value to see if
the correlation between two variables is just as likely to occur through noise
